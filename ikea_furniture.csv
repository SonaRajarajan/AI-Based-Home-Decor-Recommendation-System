Handles make it easy to move.Make sure the cushions are completely dry before storing them away in the storage box.During the off-season, store the box filled with cushions in a cool dry place indoors.The storage box is light in weight, so you may need to fill it to keep it from moving around in the wind.For example, the storage box can be filled with 3 seat cushions and 3 back cushions for outdoor sofas and 4 decorative cushions.For example, the storage box can be filled with 6 seat/back cushions and 6 decorative cushions.For example, the storage box can be filled with 2 seat cushions and 2 back cushions for outdoor sofas, 2 chair cushions for armchairs and 2-4 decorative cushions.",44.0,79.0,129.0,714,921,"[""Not bad, but assembly took longer than expected."", ""Amazing!
